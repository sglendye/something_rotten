# Introduction

The [Geena Davis Institute](https://seejane.org/), the first ever global study on female characters in popular films “reveals deep-seated discrimination and pervasive stereotyping of women and girls by the international film industry”. The [findings](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/geena-davis-study-press-release) were shocking. They concluded that fewer than one third of all speaking characters in film are female. Worse yet, they discovered systematic bias in representation of men vs women in characters such as “attorneys and judges (13 to 1), professors (16 to 1), and doctors (5 to 1)”. Indeed, Hollywood has a problem with women. The good news is that this problem may be rectified, as female directors on average bring on female writers [53% of the time and women’s representation on screen is 50% higher in female directed films](https://www.alittlebithuman.com/why-there-are-so-few-women-filmmakers/). But unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, of the 1452 films analyzed in the Geena Davis Institute study, only 20.5% were directed by women. So while women filmmakers are more likely to produce work that’s equitable to women, they aren’t being given the opportunity to do so.

This topic has been written about [ad](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20191129-why-arent-there-more-women-film-directors) [nauseum](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2022/01/03/fewer-female-directors-on-top-grossing-films-in-2021/?sh=429a462363b1) [in](https://www.varsity.co.uk/film-and-tv/18562) [the](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/31/female-film-makers) [media](https://www.alittlebithuman.com/why-there-are-so-few-women-filmmakers/). Some glaring potential reasons for so few female filmmakers may include women being driven out by the rampant sexual abuse underscored by the #MeToo movement; or perhaps (male dominated) producers make stronger personal connections with male filmmakers, thus making it easier for men to reach out and secure funding. But perhaps more subtly, and less talked about, is the idea that production studios systematically discriminate against works that their research deems to be “too risky” to bring to the box office. But what if the definition of a “risky” film is implicitly determined by systems of oppression?

One such potential cause for “risk” is the role of film reviews in the success of a film. This [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkg.67.4.103.18692?journalCode=jmxa), conducted over an 8-week period that found that film reviews both positive and negative had a strong influence on box office performance. Prior to watching the 2022 film Persuasion with my wife, she and I read the rather appalling [critic reviews and Tomatometer score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/persuasion) for it. We braced ourselves for what we anticipated to be a “bad movie night” experience and left confused after seeing a rather decent film. Sure it leaves room for (what film doesn't?), but certainly nothing warranting such dismal reviews. My wife and I questioned if film reviews had even implicitly biased us to not respect a film that was made by female director, prominently featuring female characters. Is this something that could be happening systematically, potentially impacting the success of films that all women create?

This analysis seeks to explore if there is a gender bias in critic reviews of women directed works vs works directed by men and, if so, proposes a new "bias adjusted" scoring system as an alternative to the typically used "Tomatometer".
